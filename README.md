# <p align="center">Hello!</p> 
#### <p align="center">My name is Josh or Tac0 depending on how you know me.</p>  

My initial reason for being on here was to publish examples to help people out with making discord bots using **discord.py**. However, as of late I haven't been doing any work using discord.py and my bot is currently out of commission, but I still have experience if you need any help.

If you do need any help with anything and think I may be able to lend a hand, feel free to contact me via discord, my tag is Tac0 ðŸ’š#3449

With the exception of my previous discord.py work, I will occasionally upload small amateur projects for fun.

Have a nice day!
